# ProgramBinder
This allows you to set keybinds for individual programs/windows for Windows. The purpose of this is to solve the problem of tabbing between programs. Swapping between specific Chrome tabs can be tedious and annoying. Going between music, a textbook, a calendar, a forum, and Word is time-consuming. This allows you to set a custom keybind for each program, so swapping to music and back to the previous application is one click away.

# Is it perfect?
No. There seems to be a problem with some Lenovo software that causes weird num_lock behavior. Further time is required to fully test the application to make the user experience seamless. It works, but one "mistake" can mean having to rebind everything. These problems are being looked into.
