# ProgramBinder
This allows you to set keybinds for individual programs/windows for Windows. The purpose of this is to solve the problem of tabbing between programs. Swapping between a specific chrome tabs can be tedious and annoying. Going between music, a textbook, a calendar, a forum, and Word is time consuming. This allows you to set a custom keybind for each program, so swapping to music and back to the previous application is one click away.

# Is it perfect?
No. There seems to be a problem with some Lenovo software that causes weird num_lock behavior. Further time is required to fully test the application to make user experience seamless. It works, but it isn't fun. These problems are being looked into.
